title: "Judo: Addressing the Energy Asymmetry of Wireless Embedded Systems
  through Tunnel Diode based Wireless Transmitters"
abstract: >+
  The radio transmitter is the most power-consuming component of a wireless
  embedded system. We present Judo, a radio transmitter that enables power
  balance between the wireless transmission, sensing, and processing tasks of a
  wireless embedded system. Judo transmitters leverage the fact that modern
  radio transceivers offer high receive sensitivity at low power. Therefore,
  even if the radio transmitter emits a weak signal, the link budget and
  transmission range will often remain high. With this key insight, we revisit
  the radio transmitter architecture by dramatically reducing the radiated power
  and hence the overall power draws. Specifically, Judo transmitter uses a
  tunnel diode oscillator to integrate the stages of a radio transmitter into a
  single energy-efficient step. In this step, baseband signals are generated and
  mixed using peak power below 100 Î¼W. However, we sacrifice stability of tunnel
  diode oscillator for low-power consumption. We use the injection-locking
  phenomenon to stabilise the tunnel diode oscillator with an external carrier
  signal. Based on this novel architecture, we implement a transmitter that
  supports frequency-shift keying as a modulation scheme. Judo transmits over
  distances greater than 100 m at a bit rate of 100 kbps. It does so with an
  emitter device providing the carrier signal, and located at a distance of more
  than 100 m from Judo transmitter. In terms of critical link metrics, it
  outperforms the radio transmitters commonly used in wireless embedded systems.
